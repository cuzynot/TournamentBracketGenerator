# Tournament-Bracket-

How is our bracket numbered? 

Our bracket is numbered from 1 .. # of rounds and 1 .. # of matches.

The first round is the chronologically first round. 

It should be noted that the loser bracket contains more rounds than the winner's bracket. 
Sometimes, loser bracket rounds are interspersed between winner bracket rounds. 

Sometimes, a winner bracket match may advance its winner to another winner bracket match 2 rounds ahead.
This is because in between the matches, a round of loser bracket matches happens.
